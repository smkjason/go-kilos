# go-kilos

This is a personal project, inspired by [kilos](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html). It is a minimal text editor. My goals from this personal project are:

- Get better with Go
- Learn Vim Motions
- Have something to add to my resume
- Learn data structures and algorithms
- Have fun.
